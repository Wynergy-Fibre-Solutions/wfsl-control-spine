WFSL GOVERNANCE RULES

Purpose
- Define how changes are proposed, reviewed, and accepted
- Protect portfolio integrity and investor confidence
- Decouple governance from tooling constraints

Change Paths
1. Documentation Changes
   - May be committed directly during bootstrap
   - Must reference existing artefacts
   - No retroactive edits to frozen content

2. Asset Registration
   - Requires update to ASSETS.md
   - Must include status and evidence tags
   - Freeze requires a versioned tag

3. Portfolio Freezes
   - Snapshot tag required
   - Freeze tag required
   - No further changes without new version

Branch Discipline
- Default branch represents current governance truth
- Remediation and experiments use isolated branches
- No mixing of portfolio and remediation work

Signing Policy
- Signed commits and tags are the standard
- Temporary exceptions are documented
- Exceptions must be resolved on clean environments

Review Principles
- Evidence before promotion
- Governance before growth
- Clarity over speed

Authority
- The Control Spine is the final arbiter
- Conflicts are resolved by documented state, not opinion
